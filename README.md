# Another just-for-fun fork of the original ID-Software's DOOM engine

- and as such it is not meant to be anything more, like complete, working,
supported or whatever. It will be used just to see how things have been done
and what eventually can be done with it (assuming I will have some free time
to play with it...).

I have started taking
[the original code of linux-xdoom](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM)
and trying to make it working using SDL as video API (instead of Xlib) - what
should make it simpler and a lot more portable (and free from some X11
nightmares...).

Quick'n'dirty version is ready, most features of the original xdoom
are in place (except mouse support - missing for now...), fixed also few bugs
of the original code.

### Status
Works for me. ;-)
